## HERO SQUAD WEEK 9 IP
Create an app that allows you to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes (or any other
character-type of your choosing).
 Create a Hero object: At the very least, they should have a name, age, special power, and
weakness. Special powers and weaknesses could be freely assignable, or you may offer users a
pre-determined set to choose from.
 Create a Squad object: They should have a max size, name, and a cause they’re dedicated to
fighting (sexism, computer illiteracy, not covering your mouth when you sneeze, hogging bus
seats with your backpack, passive-aggressive post-it notes, etc).
 Allow users to assign Hero’s to a Squad. Each hero can only participate in one Squad at a time.
 You could even calculate scores for a specific skill area for your squad (defense, distance
attacks, etc), or begin to integrate a turn-based battle system.
